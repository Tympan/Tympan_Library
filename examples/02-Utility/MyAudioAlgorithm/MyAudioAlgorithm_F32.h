   MyAudioAlgorithm

   Created: Chip Audette, OpenAudio April 2017
   Purpose; Here is the skeleton of a audio processing algorithm that will
       (hopefully) make it easier for people to start making their own 
       algorithm.
  
   This processes a single stream fo audio data (ie, it is mono)
